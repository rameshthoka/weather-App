# weather-App
By using HTML, css, Javascript(API)
Recently I have Created a Weather App by using HTML, CSS, Javascript(API's).
 You may learn about the weather in any location with the aid of our JavaScript weather app. Any city’s information, including the temperature, date, and sky conditions, can be found below if you enter its name in the input box below.
The weather in any city in the world can be simply known with the use of this straightforward weather application. With the aid of JQuery,
The weather information for all towns and nations was fetched using the APIs in our weather app. I’m not sure how many of you are familiar with APIs, but if you’re not, don’t worry; we designed this project beginner-friendly, so we will explain every concepts that we used in our project.

✍1. What is an API ?
 Application Programming Interface is referred to as API. The term “application” in the context of APIs refers to any software with a specific purpose. A contract of service between two apps can be compared to an interface. This agreement specifies the requests and responses that the two computer will use to communicate. Developers can find instructions in their API documentation on how to format those requests and responses.
